## Course Overview (Important)

This is a beginner to moderate intermediate level course about developing a Prototype Online Banking System using latest web technologies with Hands-on experience. You will follow my guide to develop the front-end and back-end (full stack) from scratch. 

However, there are two points I'd like mention:

1. As this course is NOT an introduction to Java, Spring or Angular 2, it assumes you have the basic knowledge of them. 

2. That being said, a lot of times I'll just copy and paste in the code during the development and you need to pause the video to input them. 

The Banking system consists of two parts: User-Front and Admin-Portal. User-Front is a user-facing system and it includes such modules as User Signup/Login, Account, Transfer, Appointment, Transaction and User Profile. Admin-Portal is mainly used by Admin and it involves User Account and Appointment modules. 

## Why This Course?

This covers a lot of functions and features with details. By the time you finish this course, you will expose yourself to much information and hands-on practice on both system level design and detail level development.

## What to Expect in this course?

You will develop modules and functions with me along the course. You should have some understanding on front-end and back-end development using Angular 2, Java, Spring Framework. You will need to constantly look back and search online for ideas and concepts that you need to understand so that you don't get lost. Practicing without understanding is just a waste of time.

## Technologies Used in this course

A wide range of technologies are involved in this course and project development.

Front-end: Html/CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular 2 and some JS plugins, Thymeleaf and etc
